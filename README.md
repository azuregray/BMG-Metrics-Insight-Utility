## **`INSTALLATION/SETUP`**

> Step 01: Please use our [**`LATEST RELEASE PAGE`**](https://github.com/azuregray/BMG-Metrics-Insight-Utility/releases/latest) and find **`BMGMIU.zip`**

> Step 02: Extract **`BMGMIU.zip`** in your Downloads folder into a new folder.

> Step 03: After you extract the contents into a folder:

As we have provided a `requirements.txt` file, Just run this in a Terminal `Interpreter: PowerShell`:

```
python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt; streamlit run ./app.py
```

Please note that this tool has been tried and tested on `WINDOWS` OS only. Setup instruction on Linux Systems or Server and MacOS may differ.

## **`For Developers / Debuggers / Automation Staff:`**

> There's one hidden CLI Interface for the app built into **`UnitValuesRendering.py`**.

So you may just run the following command to quickly run a CLI interface of the program specifically designed to be just as good as web interface.

```
python ./UnitValuesRendering.py
```

Helpful for testing all the functionality given in the program. 
It has a built in Error Handler and Error Logging Mechanism, so that you can efficiently debug/develop.
