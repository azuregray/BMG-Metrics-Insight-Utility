## **`For Developers / Debuggers / Automation Staff:`**

> There's one hidden CLI Interface for the app built into **`UnitValuesRendering.py`**.

So you may just run the following command to quickly run a CLI interface of the program specifically designed to be just as good as web interface.

```
python ./UnitValuesRendering.py
```

Helpful for testing all the functionality given in the program. 
It has a built in Error Handler and Error Logging Mechanism, so that you can efficiently debug/develop.
